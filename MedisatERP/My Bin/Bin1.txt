Here's a flow diagram of the **Subscription Logic** that integrates the **demo period** with the overall subscription system, as you outlined:

### **Flow Diagram for Subscription Logic with Demo Period Integration**

1. **User Registration**
   - User creates an account.
   - Option to select a subscription plan (including trial option).
   
2. **Trial Period Begins**  
   - Trial period starts (e.g., 30-day free trial of a premium plan).
   - User has access to all premium features.

3. **Tracking Trial Period**  
   - System tracks trial start and end dates.
   - Notifications are set to remind the user before trial expires (e.g., 7 days, 1 day before).
   
4. **Trial Period Ends**
   - Send reminder notifications (e.g., “Trial ending soon, select a plan”).
   - User has options:
     - **Upgrade to Paid Plan**: Automatically use payment details if provided.
     - **Cancel Subscription**: Option to cancel without payment.
     - **Grace Period (optional)**: Provide a brief extension (e.g., 3 days) to finalize payment or decision.

5. **Post-Trial Access**
   - If no action is taken:
     - **Limited Access**: User is restricted to basic features.
     - **No Access**: User loses all access until payment or plan selection is made.
   
6. **Payment Processing**
   - If the user chooses to upgrade, payment is processed.
   - If payment is successful:
     - **Activate Subscription**: User receives access to the full plan features.
     - **Grant Access**: Full access according to the selected plan.

7. **Subscription Renewal and Expiry**  
   - **Automatic Renewal**: Subscription renews at the end of each cycle.
   - **Manual Cancellation**: Option for user to cancel at any time.
   - **Expiration**: Notifications sent on renewal expiry or payment failure.
  
8. **Usage Monitoring**
   - Monitor usage based on the selected plan.
   - Send notifications when approaching usage limits or overages.
   
9. **Reporting and Analytics (Admin)**  
   - Generate subscription reports for metrics like trial-to-paid conversion, payment status, usage data.

### **Key Considerations:**

- **Seamless Transition**: The system should ensure smooth transitions from the trial period to the paid subscription, either automatically or with clear prompts for action.
  
- **Access Control**: Restrict access to features based on the user’s chosen plan after the trial period ends.

- **Payment Information**: You can choose whether to collect payment details upfront or prompt users to enter details as the trial period nears its end.

- **Notifications**: Regular reminders and notifications about trial expiration, payment details, and renewal help keep the user informed.

By following this flow, you can create a user-friendly, integrated subscription system that simplifies both the user's experience and the system's management, 
while also ensuring that financial and access control aspects are handled effectively.

When considering which tables to expose to admins on the frontend, the goal is to ensure that the admins can effectively manage the subscription system without being overwhelmed by unnecessary data. It’s crucial to provide a streamlined, functional interface that focuses on the key tasks they need to accomplish. 

Based on the provided schema, here are the tables I would recommend exposing to the admins in the frontend, along with the rationale for each:

### **1. Subscriptions Table**
- **Why**: The **Subscriptions** table is central to the subscription logic. It contains key information like user subscription status, plan details, trial start/end dates, payment status, and expiration dates.
- **Admin Usage**: Admins can manage user subscriptions, upgrade/downgrade subscriptions, monitor trial periods, and see which subscriptions are active, expired, or canceled.
  
### **2. Payments Table**
- **Why**: The **Payments** table tracks payments made by users, their statuses, and payment methods. This is crucial for admins to monitor revenue, track successful and failed payments, and follow up on issues.
- **Admin Usage**: Admins can view and manage payments, see payment failures, refunds, and successful payments, and investigate payment issues.

### **3. Subscription Logs Table**
- **Why**: The **Subscription Logs** table tracks changes to subscriptions, such as upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, renewals, and failed payments. This helps admins understand the history of subscription changes.
- **Admin Usage**: Admins can view subscription change history, which is useful for troubleshooting, auditing, and tracking trends (e.g., reasons for cancellations or failed renewals).

### **4. Subscription Reports Table (Admin)**
- **Why**: The **Subscription Reports** table provides aggregated data that admins need for decision-making. It includes key metrics such as total active subscriptions, revenue, conversions from trials to paid plans, cancellations, etc.
- **Admin Usage**: Admins can generate financial and performance reports, monitor subscription trends, and track revenue generation. This data is essential for analytics, business planning, and resource allocation.

### **5. Subscription Plans Table**
- **Why**: The **Subscription Plans** table defines the available subscription plans. While this data isn't as dynamic as user or payment data, it is useful for admin management.
- **Admin Usage**: Admins can view, add, modify, or delete subscription plans. This table also helps admins set the pricing, features, and billing cycle for different plans offered to users.

### **6. Trial Notifications Table**
- **Why**: The **Trial Notifications** table stores information about notifications sent to users regarding their trial period, including reminder emails and messages.
- **Admin Usage**: Admins can monitor and manage notifications, ensuring users are being informed about trial expirations and guiding them toward a paid plan or cancellation. It also helps track the effectiveness of these notifications.

### **Not Recommended to Display in the Frontend:**
- **Users Table**: Since the **Users** table contains sensitive user information (e.g., email addresses, passwords), it should not be displayed in full in the admin interface. Instead, admins can access user-specific details through the **Subscriptions Table** (linked by `user_id`) without exposing all user data.
- **Subscription Usage Table**: This table tracks granular data about user usage, which may be highly specific and not necessary for most administrative tasks. You may consider exposing this table if there is a need to monitor usage patterns or resource consumption, but it's not essential for all admins.
  
### **Recommended Frontend UI Views for Admins:**
- **User Management Dashboard**: Display the **Users** and **Subscriptions** data in an easy-to-read dashboard, with options to view, filter, and manage user subscriptions.
- **Subscription Details**: Show detailed subscription info for each user, including active plans, trial periods, payment status, and any changes in their subscription status (using **Subscription Logs**).
- **Payment History**: Provide a list of payments made, along with their statuses, and the ability to resolve payment issues.
- **Reports Dashboard**: Generate and display reports on subscription metrics, including total subscriptions, trial conversions, cancellations, and revenue (using **Subscription Reports**).
- **Plan Management**: Allow admins to manage and update subscription plans (using **Subscription Plans**), including modifying pricing and feature lists.
- **Trial Notification Management**: Let admins review and edit trial-related notifications sent to users (using **Trial Notifications**).

---

### **In Summary:**

Admins should be able to view and interact with the following tables on the frontend:

- **Subscriptions**: To manage and monitor active subscriptions.
- **Payments**: For tracking payments, issues, and revenue.
- **Subscription Logs**: To see history and track changes in subscriptions.
- **Subscription Reports**: To analyze performance and revenue metrics.
- **Subscription Plans**: For managing available plans and pricing.
- **Trial Notifications**: To manage and monitor trial-related communications with users.

By keeping the admin interface focused on these tables, you will provide them with the essential tools to manage subscriptions efficiently while keeping the UI clean and intuitive.
